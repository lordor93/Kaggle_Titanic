# Objective
The goal is to predict the survival or the death of a given passenger based on a set of variables describing him such as his age, his sex, or his passenger class on the boat
# Data Dictionary
## Variable	-- Definition	Key
- survival - Survival	-> 0 = No, 1 = Yes
- pclass - Ticket class ->	1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd
- sex	-     Sex	
- Age	- Age in years	
- sibsp - # of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic	
- parch	- # of parents / children aboard the Titanic	
- ticket - Ticket number	
- fare - 	Passenger fare	
- cabin	- Cabin number	
- embarked -	Port of Embarkation	C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton
# Variable Notes
- pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower

- age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

- sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way ->
 Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister 
-> Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)
- parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
- Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
# Note
To run the project, it is sufficient to run the "python main.py" command from the terminal in the project directory.
